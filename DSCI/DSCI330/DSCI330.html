  Descriptiion:

         This course will give students an overview of the issues related to the management of 
unstructured data, i.e. data not stored in a table or database. Sources of unstructured data include 
bodies of text, social media applications, images, and audio. In the process of exploring various forms 
of unstructured data, students will be exposed to new programming languages and tools that are useful 
for managing this type of data (e.g. Python and bash). Other topics covered in the course include web 
scraping, natural language processing, and manipulating images/videos/audio files. Prerequisites: DSCI 
210 and CS 234, or instructorÂ¿s permission. Offered alternate years.
