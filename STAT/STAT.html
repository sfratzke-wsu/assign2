  Data are everywhere. Statistics is the science of data interpretation, of using data to arrive at 
informed, intelligent decisions. Data are just the raw material of knowledge; being a statistician 
means having the ability to extract, synthesize, and communicate meaning from the sea of data that 
surrounds us in our information-saturated world. From astronomy; biology; economics; social science; 
education; public health; psychology; medicine; sports; and marketing; statisticians are relied on 
to advance the state of knowledge in the field. As statistician John Tukey put it, “The best thing 
about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone else’s back yard.”

And another best thing about being a statistician? Employers want you! According to the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the demand for individuals with a background is statistics is projected to grow. 
Employment of statisticians is projected to increase 27% percent from 2012 to 2022, much faster than 
the average job. This growth is expected to result from more widespread use of statistical analysis 
to make informed business, healthcare, and policy decisions. Furthermore, an increasing number of 
positions are available for those with only a bachelor’s level training.
